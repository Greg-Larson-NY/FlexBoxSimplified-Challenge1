An example challenge from Kevin Powell's class called Flexbox Simplified:

This challenge is a simple one and was simply to illustrate the use of Flex Grow/Shrink in practical use and in a visual was. The lesson illustrates how the properties can be used on the parent container or the child items individually and at differing rates of change with simple variables.
